<h1>Downloading Videos and Issues</h1>  
A script to download recordings from YouTube is provided in the Github repository as  we cannot host the videos due to copyright issues. 
We encourage you to send an email to <span>juanfelipe.montesinos@upf.edu</span> to request already-processed videos for research purposes.  
If you have any other issue related to the code nor the data have a look at the Github Repository.
