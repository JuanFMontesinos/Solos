Raw data can be downloaded from GDrive. It fits the original output of OpenPose. There is a single `.json` file per frame containing all
the predictions from OpenPose framework. Check [OpenPose Docs](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/tree/master/doc/media)
for additional information about the format.  

Due to copyright and data protection issues we cannot provide original videos. Feel free to send an email in case you need something related to that.
