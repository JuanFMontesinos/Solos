Raw data can be downloaded from [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15zbguoWtDWDBHWXFl9Gbvu6IA48IBfYB/view?usp=sharing). It fits the original output of OpenPose. There is a single `.json` file per frame containing 
the predictions from OpenPose framework. Check [OpenPose Docs](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/tree/master/doc/media)
for additional information about the format.
