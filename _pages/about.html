<p>Solos is a YouTube gathered dataset containing music excerpts of players playing different instruments for auditions.<br>
This dataset is complementary to other datasets of this nature such us MUSIC and MUSICes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Solos provide frame-wise human skeletons for the soloist computed using
<a href="https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/">OpenPose</a>. For each frame we provide meaningful joints, namely, the upperbody joints + hand detection.</p>

In the next video we can see skeletons provided for both, the interpolated and non-interpolated case. Skeletons have been colored according to 
the network confidence. The more blue the more confident the network is. The more red, the less confidence the network is. Green is used when 
the network fails to predict a joint (miss-prediction).

As we can observe, once the network fails to predict a joint, the joint position goes to (0,0), the top left of the image. This harms DL models performance.
That is why we do provide an interpolated version as described in the work. 
We also can observe there is a flickering effect in the joint position due to the fact they are computed framewise. In order to address this problem 
we recommend to use a savgol filter.
<h1>Categories</h1>  
Solos contains the same categories than

This is intended in order to be able to use URMP as test set.
