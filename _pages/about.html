Test
Solos is a YouTube gathered dataset containing music excerpts of players playing different instruments for auditions.  
Solos is complementary to other datasets of this nature such us MUSIC and MUSICes.  

Solos provide frame-wise human skeletons for the soloist computed using [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose). For each frame we provide meaningful joints, namely, the upperbody joints + hand detection.

# Categories  
Solos contains the same categories than [URMP Dataset](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/projects/air/projects/URMP.html)

This is intended in order to be able to use URMP as test set.
