<p>Solos is a YouTube gathered dataset containing music excerpts of players playing different instruments for auditions.<br>
<p>Solos is complementary to other datasets of this nature such us MUSIC and MUSICes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Solos provide frame-wise human skeletons for the soloist computed using
<a href="https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/">OpenPose</a>. For each frame we provide meaningful joints, namely, the upperbody joints + hand detection.</p>
