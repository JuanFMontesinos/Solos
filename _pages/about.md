Solos is a YouTube gathered dataset containing music excerpts of players playing different instruments for auditions.  
Solos is complementary to other datasets of this nature such us MUSIC and MUSICes.  

Solos provide frame-wise human skeletons for the soloist computed using [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose). For each frame we provide meaningful joints, namely, the upperbody joints + hand detection.
